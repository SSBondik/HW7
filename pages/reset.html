            <p>ONCE UPON A TIME, a Princess named Snow White lived in a castle with her father the King and her
                Stepmother the Queen.
                Her father always reminded his daughter that above all else, a royal family must be fair. He
                said,
                “People over all the
                land come to the castle to settle disputes. The ruler must hear each side and make a decision
                that's
                fair.”</p>

            <p>The Queen, Snow White's stepmother, knew how important being fair was to her husband. She went to
                her
                magic mirror and
                asked, “Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?”</p>

            <p>“Snow White is the fairest of them all!” said the Magic Mirror.</p>

            <p>“What?!” shouted the Queen in surprise. “No one is more fair than I! The Queen must be the best
                at
                everything. What's
                more fair than that?”</p>

                alt="queen">

            <p>“Snow White is the fairest of them all!” stated the Magic Mirror again.</p>

            <p>The Queen shook her fists. “What do you know? - you're a mirror!” She threw a blanket over the
                mirror
                and stormed off.</p>

            <p>Still, the Queen was bothered. So much so, that the Queen decided to be rid of the girl, once and
                for
                all.</p>

            <p>“I cannot wait another day to deal with her!” she resolved. The Queen called for her servant, a
                huntsman. Pointing her
                long fingernail at him she said, “Tomorrow, find a reason to take Snow White deep into the
                woods.
                And kill her.”</p>

            <div class="clear"> Обтикание закончилось &#9786; </div>

            <p>The huntsman was shocked! But she was the Queen - what could he do? The next day he took Snow
                White
                into the woods. As
                he drew his knife to slay her, Snow White turned around.</p>

            <p>“Look,” she said. She took from her pocket six perfect animal shapes carved of wood. “I made them
                for
                you.”</p>

            <p>“Snow White,” cried the huntsman, dropping to his knees. “I cannot do this!”</p>

            <img class="right"

                alt="snow-white">

            <p>“You must accept them, they are a gift,” said Snow White.</p>

            <p>"That's not what I meant!" said the servant. “How can I say this? The Queen, your stepmother,
                ordered
                me to kill you.”
                The huntsman dropped to his knees. “But I cannot!”</p>

            <p>“She what?” Snow White called out with alarm.</p>

            <p>“You must run away!” said the huntsman. “Far away. Now! And never go back to the castle!”</p>

            <p>Snow White turned and ran into the woods as fast as she could.</p>

            <p>Deeper and deeper into the darkening woods she ran. Wolves were starting to howl. She tripped and
                tore her skirt, but
                kept running. Tall tree branches seemed to reach down to the very ground to grab her, but she
                kept
                running. She was
                scratched, bleeding, and scared, but ran on till she could run no more.</p>

            <p>All of a sudden, a light blinked far in the distance. Who would live so deep in the woods? She
                stepped up closer to the
                light. It came from a cottage, yet no sound came from the cottage, only the flickering light
                from
                the windows.</p>
